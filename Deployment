🚀 Successfully Deployed a 3-Tier Website Using DevOps Automation! 🔧🌐
Deployed a production-ready website by implementing a robust DevOps pipeline – all automated from code commit to Kubernetes deployment!

🧑‍💻 Development & Version Control
Developers push code to GitHub, triggering the Jenkins CI pipeline.
🔄 CI Pipeline (Jenkins)
Pulls code and checks dependencies via OWASP.
Performs code analysis using SonarQube.
Scans the container filesystem for vulnerabilities with Trivy.
Builds and pushes Docker images to the registry.
🚀 CD Pipeline (Jenkins)
Automatically updates Docker image versions.
Triggers ArgoCD to pull the latest image and deploy it to Kubernetes (K8s).
📡 Monitoring & Notification
Email notifications are sent upon deployment.
Real-time monitoring is handled by Prometheus and Grafana dashboards.
🔐 Security + Quality + Speed – all integrated into one automated workflow!
This was an incredible hands-on learning experience, and I’m proud of how each component came together to form a seamless delivery pipeline.
